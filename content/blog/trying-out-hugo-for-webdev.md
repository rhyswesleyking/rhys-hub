## Honestly I'm kinda confused but I like it so far.

With my first website I basically just taught myself how to make a basic static site with vanilla HTML and CSS (didn't even touch Javascript lol) and that's probably hurting me now jumping into a framework but it's whatever. I kinda just like jumping headfirst into shit and just seeing how far I can go.

Currently I'm just sitting outside of Perk! trying to brute force myself into understanding this and it's kind of a vibe.

My goal for today is basically to get this site up and running but we'll see if I can actually get that done. Lots to port over and then I gotta figure out how to deploy it through Github and Cloudflare to push it to the internet.

That being said, I'll just stop it here since I'm limited on time. Hope this turns out good!
