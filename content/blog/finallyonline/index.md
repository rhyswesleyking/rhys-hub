## So that took a few weeks to actually get running haha.

I think I spent around four hours at the library yesterday endlessly pouring through Cloudflare and Hugo documentation just trying to figure out that exact magic combination. It turns out I had almost successfully done it a few weeks ago when I first posted, but something as simple as the "baseURL" not being set properly in my .toml config file is what caused my website to not work properly (front page would work fine, but then it would link to my [rhyswesleyking.cc](https://rhyswesleyking.cc) website lol).

Now I'm at a crossroads, because I'm not a huge fan of this theme--at least for a portfolio page that normal people will see--but I don't want to completely overwhelm myself with new information by completely reconfiguring everything I've already made here. For the time being I'm going to keep it on this little "terminal-esque" theme until I can learn a little more about how this framework functions. I honestly don't really know what I'm trying to do with all of this anyway though, because I'm still struggling to choose something to make a solid business out of. I just like to do too many things! I don't know, I just wish I could get out of my own way and stick to something.

My main curiosity recently has been whether or not I could make separate pages with subdomains that have different templates. That might solve a few things for me, because if someone wants to only see my photography for example I could just send them to something like "photography.rhyswesleyking.cc" or if they just want to hear examples of music I've created/performed it could be "audio.rhyswesleyking.cc". Hugo has some really nice looking gallery themes, but it seems like they're just a template for the entire site, whereas I want something that I can still do little blog posts with.

Unrelated but it's funny that I'm using this domain I bought as a testing ground, because I mostly only bought it to use for a future media server for friends and family. Not sure what I'll do with it but the main idea will be to eventually port this website over to my main "rhyswesleyking.cc" portfolio page. Right now I just need to iron out the kinks before I feel comfortable with people finding it through my resume or business card.

Here's a little screenshot of my current setup to spice this up a bit:
